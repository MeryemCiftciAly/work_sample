    <h1>Hi, I‚Äôm Meryem</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <p>Hi, I‚Äôm Meryem
I'm a data analyst with a genuine passion for turning complex data into clear, actionable insights. Whether I'm contributing to a collaborative team or tackling a specific project as a freelancer, my goal is always the same: to help you solve real-world problems and achieve strategic goals. </p>

      <p>My journey began in business administrative support, where I discovered my natural curiosity for finding patterns and telling stories with data. This foundation led me to complete the Google Data Analytics Certificate Program through Merit America, where I developed a strong technical skill set in trend analysis and data-driven problem-solving.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>How I Can Help</h2>
      <p>I thrive in collaborative environments where my analytical skills can support a team's strategic vision. I am committed to continuous learning and believe in aligning technical insights with broader organizational goals to create meaningful, lasting change. I love working with teams that are dedicated to purpose-driven analytics in business, health, and community work.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>For Freelance Projects</h2>
      <p>I partner with entrepreneurs, small businesses, and individual professionals as a flexible and reliable partner. I focus on turning your raw data into clear, compelling insights that give you the confidence to move forward with your business objectives. My approach is purpose-driven, ensuring you get the actionable information you need to make informed decisions.</p>

       <h2>Nuuraqlyz Analytics</h2>
      <p>Nuuraqlyz Analytics is an initiative I created to serve as a reliable one-on-one partner for clients. This flexible approach allows me to continuously grow as a data professional while directly helping individuals and small businesses turn their data into powerful, life-changing insights.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>What You Don‚Äôt Know About Me</h2>
      <p>In addition to my work in analytics, I'm a three-time published author on Amazon. When I'm not doing data analytics, I enjoy writing fictional stories about heroic characters who find their path and do good. This passion for crafting narratives with purpose directly informs my work. Just as a compelling story should guide a reader through a journey, I believe data should be presented as a clear narrative that empowers stakeholders to make confident decisions and achieve a positive outcome.</p>
