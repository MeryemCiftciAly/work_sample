    <h1>Hi, I‚Äôm Meryem</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <p>I‚Äôm a data analyst with a genuine passion for uncovering insights that drive innovation and impact. My journey into the world of data began during my time in business administrative support, where I discovered my natural curiosity and love for numbers. I found joy in the details‚Äîorganizing schedules, managing records, and, most notably, creating presentations that told a compelling story. I loved pulling reports from databases, structuring all the information meticulously, and ensuring every slide flowed seamlessly.</p>

      <p>Eager to take this passion further, I transitioned into analytics by completing the Google Data Analytics Certificate Program through Merit America. This training deepened my technical skills‚Äîexploring trends, identifying patterns, and delivering actionable solutions‚Äîand reinforced my belief that data, when used thoughtfully, can solve real-world challenges.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>What Guides My Work</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Continuous Learning:</strong> Every challenge is an opportunity to grow professionally and personally.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> I thrive in environments where technical insights are aligned with strategic goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose-Driven Analytics:</strong> I believe data has the power to create meaningful change in business, health, and community work.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>Why I Love Working with Data</h2>
      <p>Even back in my administrative days, I was captivated by how data could tell a story. Every spreadsheet was a puzzle waiting to be solved. I found joy in crafting presentations, pulling reports, organizing data, and ensuring each page communicated the right message. This spark of curiosity‚Äîseeing how simple numbers could transform into powerful insights‚Äîhas stayed with me ever since.</p>

      <p>Imagine John Doe, who follows a morning routine that energizes him during the week but feels inexplicably drained by the weekend. By analyzing his sleep patterns, activities, and habits, we can uncover hidden factors and suggest improvements. That ability to look beneath the surface and solve real-life puzzles is what excites me most about data analytics.</p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>What You Don‚Äôt Know About Me</h2>
      <p>In addition to my work in analytics, I‚Äôm also an author. I‚Äôve written three books, which are available on Amazon. Writing helps me structure complex ideas and communicate clearly‚Äîskills I use every day in data analysis.</p>
