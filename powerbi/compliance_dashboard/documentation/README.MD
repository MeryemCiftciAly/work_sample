## üìù Project Overview

This project provides an interactive dashboard analyzing participant program performance, risk profiles, and operational caseload. The goal is to move beyond simple success metrics to identify specific vulnerabilities, streamline staff resource allocation, and drive strategic interventions based on data insights.

## üîë Key Deliverables & Functionality

* **Dynamic Program Success Rate:** Tracks performance against a 40% target.
* **Segmented Risk Profiles:** Visualizes re-offense risk by age, education level, and incident severity.
* **Operational Caseload Analysis:** Identifies high-frequency incident types (e.g., Missed Appointments) to guide resource prioritization.
* **Executive Summary:** A hidden "Strategic Insights Report" page provides the final analytical conclusions and actionable recommendations, accessed only via a button.
